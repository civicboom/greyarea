A tool to re-organise a CSS file in a potentially more efficient way, inspired
by Jens Meiert's article "CSS: Using every declaration just once" [1]

Warnings:
  - The output is only *potentially* smaller. In my personal tests, I've
    found that the output is generally between 30% smaller and 30% larger.
  - The input is expected to be simple well-formed CSS with no comments;
    i.e. the sort of thing that a normal CSS minifier would output.

Usage:
  greyarea in.css out.css
  greyarea in.css >output
  greyarea <input >output

The Name:
  - It works on the principle of multiple selectors, one declaration
  - A dinghy has multiple sitters and one deck
  - The name of my last dinghy was GCU Grey Area
  - The process of rearranging the CSS file is potentially dangerous
    because CSS uses position within the file as a priority tiebreaker,
    so this tool being a good idea or not is a grey area :-)
